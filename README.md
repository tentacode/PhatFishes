Phat Fishes is a game about fishes that are phat. It's in their genes (find more about Tetraodontidae in Wikipedia).

This game was made during Ludum Dare \#35, in under 72 hours and entirely by myself (code, art and sounds).

It"s a couch multiplayer arena game up to 4 fishes. Just push the other fishes into dangerous stuff while avoiding the dangerous stuff yourself.
